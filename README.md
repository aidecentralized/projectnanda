# NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) Project Website

## About Project NANDA

NANDA (Networked Agents and Decentralized AI) is an open research initiative dedicated to developing foundational infrastructure for the Agentic Web. Our mission is to build and foster decentralized systems that empower autonomous AI agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate effectively and securely, without reliance on centralized control points.

As a non-profit academic research and software development project, NANDA focuses on:

*   Decentralized Agent Discovery: Creating mechanisms for AI agents to find each other and their capabilities across distributed networks.
*   Secure Agent Communication & Coordination: Developing protocols that ensure secure and trustworthy interactions between agents.
*   Open Source Tooling: Building and promoting open-source tools and standards to support the growth of a vibrant, interoperable ecosystem for decentralized AI.
*   Privacy-Preserving AI: Researching and implementing techniques that allow for AI collaboration while upholding user privacy and data sovereignty.

Project NANDA aims to contribute to a more resilient, equitable, and innovative future for artificial intelligence by championing decentralized principles.

*   Other `.html` files (e.g., `papers.html`, `blog.html`): Individual content pages.
*   `navbar.html`, `footer.html`: Reusable HTML snippets for the navigation bar and footer, dynamically included via JavaScript.
*   `styles.css`: Contains all styling rules for the website.
*   `script.js`: Handles the inclusion of HTML partials (like navbar/footer) and other client-side functionalities.

## Viewing the Website

*   **Live Site:** [https://aidecentralized.github.io/](https://aidecentralized.github.io/)
*   **Locally:** To view the website locally, simply clone this repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Making Modifications

Content updates can generally be made by editing the respective `.html` files directly. Shared elements like the navigation menu are located in `navbar.html`, and the footer is in `footer.html`. Styling changes should be made in `styles.css`.
