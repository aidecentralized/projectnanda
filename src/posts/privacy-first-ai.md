<p>Privacy preservation in AI systems goes beyond simple data encryption. The BreachLess principle requires fundamental changes to how we design and implement AI architectures.</p>
<p>Traditional machine learning requires centralizing data for training, creating privacy risks and regulatory challenges. Split learning and federated approaches offer alternatives, but implementation details matter significantly.</p>
<p>Key techniques include: split neural networks where different parties hold different layers, secure multi-party computation for private aggregation, differential privacy for output protection, and homomorphic encryption for computation on encrypted data.</p>
<p>Practical implementations must balance privacy guarantees with computational efficiency. Our experiments show that split learning can achieve near-centralized performance while keeping raw data distributed across participants.</p>
<p>The healthcare and financial sectors represent immediate applications where privacy-preserving AI can unlock significant value while meeting regulatory requirements.</p>
