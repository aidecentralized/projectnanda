<p>Decentralized AI represents a fundamental shift from centralized machine learning to distributed, collaborative intelligence. This post outlines the technical challenges and opportunities in building truly decentralized AI systems.</p>
<p>The current AI landscape is dominated by centralized platforms that control data, models, and inference. While this has enabled rapid progress, it also creates bottlenecks, privacy concerns, and barriers to innovation. Decentralized AI aims to address these issues through distributed architectures.</p>
<p>Key technical challenges include: agent discovery and coordination, privacy-preserving computation, consensus mechanisms for distributed training, and efficient resource allocation across heterogeneous networks.</p>
<p>Our research focuses on developing protocols and infrastructure that enable autonomous AI agents to collaborate without central coordination. This includes lightweight discovery mechanisms, cryptographic verification of agent capabilities, and incentive structures that promote network participation.</p>
